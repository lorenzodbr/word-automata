# These properties can be used to override the default values, which are:
#
# vertex.allow-user-move = true (boolean)
# vertex.radius = 15 (in pixels)
# vertex.shape = circle (string)
# vertex.tooltip = true (boolean)
# vertex.label = true (boolean)

# edge.label = true (boolean)
# edge.arrow = true (boolean)
# edge.arrowsize = 5 (in pixels)
#
# Allowed/available vertex shape names (string without quotes) are:
# - circle
# - star
# - triangle
# - square
# - pentagon
# - hexagon
# - heptagon
# - octagon
# - nonagon
# - decagon
# - hendecagon
# - dodecagon

# Notice: deprecated since version 1.1.0 Force directed layout strategies are now
# instantiated and can be swapped at runtime, per the Strategy design pattern.
# The parameters are passed as arguments or one can use the default ones described
# in the javadoc documentation.
