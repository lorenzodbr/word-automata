/**
 * Method annotation to override an element's label provider.
 * <br/>
 * The annotated method must return a value, otherwise an exception will be thrown.
 * <br/>
 * By default, the text label is obtained from the toString method if this
 * annotation is not present in any other class method; this is also the case
 * with String and other boxed-types, e.g., Integer, Double, etc.
 * <br/>
 * If multiple annotations exist, the behavior is undefined.
