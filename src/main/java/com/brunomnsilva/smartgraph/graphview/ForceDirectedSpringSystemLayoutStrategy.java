/**
 * An implementation of a spring system layout strategy. This strategy allows to
 * freely move the graph along the panel, but if you have a bipartite graph, the
 * sub-graphs will repel each other to the edges of the panel.
 * <br/>
 * Parameters:
 * <br/>
 * Repulsive force (> 0): Recommended [1, 50]. Default 25. The strength of the
 * repulsive force between nodes. Higher values result in greater repulsion.
 * <br/>
 * Attraction force (> 0): Recommended [1, 5]. Default 3. The strength of the
 * attractive force between connected nodes. Higher values result in stronger
 * attraction. Careful, because larger values may not produce stable states.
 * <br/>
 * Attraction scale (> 0): Recommended [1, ?]. Default 10. The scale factor for
 * attraction. It determines the effectiveness of the attraction force based on
 * the distance between connected nodes.
 * <br/>
 * Acceleration: Mandatory ]0, 1]. Default 0.8. The acceleration factor applied
 * to node movements. Higher values result in faster movements.
 *
 * @param <V> The generic type of {@link SmartGraphVertexNode}, i.e., the nodes
 *            of a {@link SmartGraphPanel}.
