# Word Automata
> Final project for my Software Engineering course @ UniVR &mdash; A.Y. 2023/2024

## Description

Word Automata is a graphical tool that allows you to create and simulate automata that recognize words. You can add states, transitions, and set the initial and final states. The tool will then allow you to simulate the automaton on a given word, showing you the path that the automaton takes.

## Installation

Instructions will be added soonâ„¢.

## Usage

### Adding a state

![Adding a state](res/state.gif)

> Note: you can choose if a state should be final on creation. You can also change this property later.

### Adding a transition

### Setting the initial state

![Setting the initial state](res/initial_state.gif)

> By default, the initial state is the first state you add. You can change this by right-clicking on a state and selecting "Set as initial state".

### Edit a state

![Edit a state](res/edit_state.gif)

> In this section you can edit the state label and set it as final. You can also delete the state or add transitions bounded to it.

### Search for a word

> The action will show you the path that the automaton takes on the given word, highlighting the followed transitions.
